### Reset Your Wallet
- When you run out of money, this is how you Reset

- It resets the user object

### Make a Bunch More users
 - show off user creation process (make more users - one for each of us)

### Change Difficulty
- Show off easy mode. On each spin, we shuffle the emoji deck and replace 1 with emoji with a wildcard for medium. For easy more, two emojis are replaced
- Each user can set custom preferences that are persisted across pages and users
- show how game settings change when you select user from drop down

### Stats
- (make sure there are four users at this point and that they have different balances)
- we rank the users by money at top of stats pages
- we use chart.js to display interactive charts for each user

## Questions?
