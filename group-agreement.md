# Group Agreement

# Communication Plan
- We will meet each day to work individually and as a team in person.
- Concept questions will be discussed in a round table format where everyone must contribute and no single person speaks for more than a few minutes.
- Start morning at 9am with a mini sprint planning session to assign and plan daily tasks
- End each day with a mini sprint retrospective to review progress.
# Conflict plan
- Any type of conflict lasting more than 5 minutes or that is stopping group progress needs to be documented in the project management tool and discussed with the whole group.
- Non-blocked conflicts can be discussed in sprint sessions
- Everyone will be open and bring up issues quickly as to not fester. If needed, grab a TA.
# Work Plan
- Tasks will be identified through our sprint planning sessions and the technical requirements set at the beginning of the project
- Team contribution will be qualified in time spent. We are all at different levels and have different skills so as long as each putting in our time, contribution will be fairly distributed.
- As technical requirements arise, we will self selection which tasks to work on. If there is a conflict, we will draw straws to determine who receives a given task.
- If a team member is struggling for more than 15 minutes, grab another team member and do some pair programming to work it out.
- We will establish general naming conventions at the start of our project, and if there is any conflict, it will be brought to the group.
- A task is complete is complete when it's hit MVP and been successfully merged into development by another team member.
- Each day a new person will be in charge of project management and PRs.
- If we are working int he same file, we will pair program.
# Git Process
- Merge individual branches to master throughout the day, and then merge to gh-pages at the end of the day at sprint retrospective.
- We will merge onto the master branch as we go, and work on individually named branches as we work.
- When someone wants to merge, we will as a whole group review the merge, and pull back to our master when finished. Merges will happen every 1-2 hours.
- At morning spring planning, assign tasks and access merge conflict potential.
# Schedules
- Evening retrospective will happen at 5pm to enable folks to catch reasonable buses.
- Lunch can be flexible time as long as it doesn't become an issue.
- We will self manage our breaks and lunches as long as it doesn't become an issue.
- We will plan to hit MVP by Wednesday afternoon.
- The project will be finished and deployed at 3pm on Thursday.
